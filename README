------------
Purpose:
------------
JEDI/UFO currently outputs one netCDF file per processor for each observation
  platform.  This program concatenates all the individual processor files
  into one file for each specified platform.

It essentially does the same thing as "ncrcat", but is parallel and much faster.

------------
Compilation:
------------
Edit and then run compile.csh. If someone wants to make a proper Makefile, go for it.

------------
Input:
------------
All input is provided through a namelist, which must be named "input.nml" and be in the run directory:

&share
obspath = '/glade/scratch/liuz/pandac/30km_coldstartFC_GFS_2streams/OMF/2018050300/1/Data',
obs_platforms = 'sondes','aircraft','satwind','amsua_metop-a',
output_path = './'
/

obspath : path (full or relative) to where the JEDI/UFO output files for each processor live
obs_platforms : list of observation types to concatenate
output_path : path (full or relative) where you want to store the output (the concatenated files)

------------
Run:
------------
It's an MPI executable.  Run immediately after JEDI/UFO with the same number of processors used
  to run JEDI/UFO.  It should run in a few seconds

On cheyenne with intel-MPT:
mpiexec_mpt ./concatenate_netcdf_files.x
